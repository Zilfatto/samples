                        Cruise ships are large passenger ships used mainly for vacationing. Unlike ocean liners,
                        which are used for transport, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports-of-call,
                        where passengers may go on tours known as "shore excursions." On "cruises to nowhere" or "nowhere voyages",
                        cruise ships make two- to three-night round trips without visiting any ports of call.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Modern cruise ships, while sacrificing some qualities of seaworthiness,
                        have added amenities to cater to water tourists, with recent vessels being described as "balcony-laden floating condominiums".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Cruising has become a major part of the tourism industry, with an estimated market of $29.4 billion per year,
                       and over 19 million passengers carried worldwide annually as of 2011.[3] The industry's rapid growth has seen nine
                       or more newly built ships catering to a North American clientele added every year since 2001,
                       as well as others servicing European clientele.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As of 2020, the world's largest passenger ship is Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas.

                        <h3>Cruise ship utilization</h3>
                        <p>
                            Due to slower speed and reduced seaworthiness, as well as being largely introduced after
                            several major wars, cruise ships have never been used as troop transport vessels.
                            By contrast, ocean liners were often seen as the pride of their country and used to rival liners
                            of other nations, and have been requisitioned during both World Wars and the Falklands War
                            to transport soldiers and serve as hospital ships.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cruise ships and former liners often find employment in applications other than those for which
                            they were built. A shortage of hotel accommodation for the 2004 Summer Olympics led to a plan
                            to moor a number of cruise ships in Athens to provide tourist accommodation.
                        </p>

                            On 1 September 2005, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) contracted three
                            Carnival Cruise Lines vessels (Carnival Fantasy, the former Carnival Holiday,
                            and the Carnival Sensation) to house Hurricane Katrina evacuees.

                            In 2010, in response to the shutdown of UK airspace due to the eruption of Iceland's<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">
                            Eyjafjallaj√∂kull</a>volcano, the newly completed Celebrity Eclipse was used to rescue 2000 British tourists stranded
                            in Spain as an act of goodwill by the owners. The ship departed from Southampton for Bilbao on 21 April, and returned on 23 April.

                            In 2017, cruise ships were used to help transport residents from some Caribbean islands destroyed by Hurricane Irma,
                            as well as Puerto Rico residents displaced by Hurricane Maria.
