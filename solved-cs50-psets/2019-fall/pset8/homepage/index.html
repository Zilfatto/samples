                    Humans' first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming. The domestication
                    of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures,
                    allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration.
                    Inventions such as the wheel and the sled helped make animal transport more efficient through
                    the introduction of vehicles. Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back
                    to time immemorial, and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large
                    distances prior to the Industrial Revolution.

                    The first forms of road transport involved animals, such as horses
                    (domesticated in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), oxen (from about 8000 BCE)[1] or
                    humans carrying goods over dirt tracks that often followed game trails. Many early civilizations,
                    including those in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, constructed paved roads. In classical antiquity,
                    the Persian and Roman empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds
                    of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. The medieval Caliphate later built tar-paved roads.
                    The first watercraft were canoes cut out from tree trunks. Early water transport was accomplished with
                    ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two.
                    The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or
                    on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. Until the Industrial Revolution,
                    transport remained slow and costly, and production
                    and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible.
