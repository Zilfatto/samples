                        A train is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles
                        that generally run along a railroad (or railway) track to transport passengers or cargo
                        (also known as "freight" or "goods"). The word "train" comes from the Old French trahiner,
                        derived from the Latin trahere meaning "to pull" or "to draw".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Motive power for a train is provided by a separate locomotive or
                        individual motors in a self-propelled multiple unit. The term "engine"
                        is often used as an alternative to locomotive. Although historically steam propulsion dominated,
                        the most common types of locomotive are diesel and electric, the latter supplied by overhead wires
                        or additional rails. Trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by engine or water-driven cable
                        or wire winch, run downhill using gravity, or powered by pneumatics, gas turbines or batteries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The track usually consists of two running rails with a fixed spacing, which may be supplemented
                        by additional rails such as electric conducting rails and rack rails.
                        Monorails and maglev guideways are also used occasionally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A passenger train includes passenger-carrying vehicles and can often be very long and fast.
                        High-speed rail service began expanding rapidly in the late 20th century,
                        and is also a major subject of further development. The term "light rail" is sometimes used
                        to refer to a modern tram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram
                        and a train, similar to a heavy rail rapid transit system.
                    </p>

                        A freight train (or goods train) uses freight cars (or wagons/trucks) to transport goods
                        or materials (cargo). It is possible to carry passengers and freight in the same train using a mixed consist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rail cars and machinery that are used for the maintenance and repair of tracks, are termed "maintenance of way"
                        equipment; these may be assembled into maintenance of way trains. Similarly, dedicated trains may be used to provide
                        support services to stations along a train line, such as garbage or revenue collection.

                        <p>
                            The first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses,
                            but from the early 19th century almost all trains were powered by steam locomotives.
                            From the 1910s onwards, steam locomotives began to be replaced with less labor-intensive
                            (and cleaner) diesel and electric locomotives, although these new forms of propulsion
                            were far more complex and expensive than steam power. At about the same time,
                            self-propelled multiple unit vehicles (both diesel and electric) became much more widely
                            used in passenger service. Dieselisation of locomotives in day-to-day use was completed
                            in most countries by the 1970s. Steam locomotives are still used in heritage railways operated
                            in many countries for the leisure and enthusiast market.

                            Electric traction offers a lower cost per mile of train operation but at a higher initial cost,
                            which can only be justified on high traffic lines. Even though the cost per mile of construction
                            is much higher, electric traction is more viable during operation because diesel import costs
                            are substantially higher. Electric trains receive their current via overhead lines or through
                            a third rail electric system.
                        </p>

                            A developing technology is fuel cells, which combine the advantage of not needing an electrical
                            system in place, with the advantage of emissionless operation. However, an impediment is substantial
                            initial cost associated with fuel cell vehicles.
