                        An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air.
                        It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil,
                        or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. Common examples of aircraft include airplanes,
                        helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors and hot air balloons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. The science of aviation,
                        including designing and building aircraft, is called aeronautics. Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot,
                        but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers.
                        Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, aircraft propulsion, usage and others.

                        <h3>Jet aircraft</h3>
                        <p>
                            Jet aircraft use airbreathing jet engines, which take in air, burn fuel with it in a combustion chamber,
                            and accelerate the exhaust rearwards to provide thrust.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Turbojet and turbofan engines use a spinning turbine to drive one or more fans, which provide additional thrust.
                            An afterburner may be used to inject extra fuel into the hot exhaust, especially on military "fast jets".
                            Use of a turbine is not absolutely necessary: other designs include the pulsejet and ramjet.
                            These mechanically simple designs cannot work when stationary, so the aircraft must be launched to flying speed
                            by some other method. Other variants have also been used, including the motorjet and hybrids such as
                            the Pratt & Whitney J58, which can convert between turbojet and ramjet operation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Compared to propellers, jet engines can provide much higher thrust, higher speeds and, above about 40,000 ft (12,000 m),
                            greater efficiency. They are also much more fuel-efficient than rockets. As a consequence nearly all large,
                            high-speed or high-altitude aircraft use jet engines.
                        </p>
