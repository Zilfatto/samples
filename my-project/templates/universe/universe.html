                            The universe (Latin: universus) is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies,
                            and all other forms of matter and energy. While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown, it is possible to measure
                            the size of the observable universe, which is currently estimated to be 93 billion light-years in diameter.
                            In various multiverse hypotheses, a universe is one of many causally disconnected constituent parts of a larger multiverse,
                            which itself comprises all of space and time and its contents; as a consequence, ‘the universe’ and ‘the multiverse’
                            are synonymous in such theories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric,
                            placing Earth at the center. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop
                            the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation,
                            Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus' work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way,
                            which is one of at least hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy have planets.
                            At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither
                            an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments
                            and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that
                            the universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then, and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.

                        <p>
                            The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe. According to estimation of
                            this theory, space and time emerged together 13.799±0.021 billion years ago and the energy and matter initially
                            present have become less dense as the universe expanded. After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch
                            at around 10−32 seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and
                            continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Dark matter gradually gathered,
                            forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity. Giant clouds of hydrogen and
                            helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and
                            everything else seen today. It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion light-years
                            because space itself has expanded, and it is still expanding today. This means that objects which are now up to 46.5 billion
                            light-years away can still be seen in their distant past, because in the past, when their light was emitted,
                            they were much closer to Earth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted
                            for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as dark matter
                            (dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly).
                            The ΛCDM model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about 69.2%±1.2% of the mass and
                            energy in the universe is a cosmological constant (or, in extensions to ΛCDM, other forms of dark energy,
                            such as a scalar field) which is responsible for the current expansion of space, and about 25.8%±1.1% is dark matter.
                            Ordinary ('baryonic') matter is therefore only 4.84%±0.1% of the physical universe. Stars, planets, and
                            visible gas clouds only form about 6% of ordinary matter, or about 0.29% of the entire universe.

                        <p>
                            There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang,
                            while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible.
                            Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which our universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.

                            The physical universe is defined as all of space and time (collectively referred to as spacetime) and their contents.
                            Such contents comprise all of energy in its various forms, including electromagnetic radiation and matter,
                            and therefore planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and the contents of intergalactic space.
                            The universe also includes the physical laws that influence energy and matter, such as conservation laws,
                            classical mechanics, and relativity.

                        <p>
                            The universe is often defined as "the totality of existence", or everything that exists, everything that has existed,
                            and everything that will exist. In fact, some philosophers and scientists support the inclusion of ideas
                            and abstract concepts—such as mathematics and logic—in the definition of the universe.
                            The word universe may also refer to concepts such as the cosmos, the world, and nature

                            The prevailing model for the evolution of the universe is the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang model states that
                            the earliest state of the universe was an extremely hot and dense one, and that the universe subsequently expanded and cooled.
                            The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space.
                            A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model,
                            is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the universe.
                            The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies,
                            the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The initial hot, dense state is called the Planck epoch, a brief period extending from time zero to one Planck time unit of
                            approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into
                            a dense state, and gravity—currently the weakest by far of the four known forces—is believed to have been as strong as
                            the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch,
                            space has been expanding to its present scale, with a very short but intense period of cosmic inflation believed
                            to have occurred within the first 10−32 seconds. This was a kind of expansion different from those we can see around us today.
                            Objects in space did not physically move; instead the metric that defines space itself changed.
                            Although objects in spacetime cannot move faster than the speed of light, this limitation does not apply to
                            the metric governing spacetime itself. This initial period of inflation is believed to explain why space appears to be very flat,
                            and much larger than light could travel since the start of the universe.

                            Within the first fraction of a second of the universe's existence, the four fundamental forces had separated.
                            As the universe continued to cool down from its inconceivably hot state, various types of subatomic particles were able to
                            form in short periods of time known as the quark epoch, the hadron epoch, and the lepton epoch. Together,
                            these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. These elementary particles associated stably
                            into ever larger combinations, including stable protons and neutrons, which then formed more complex
                            atomic nuclei through nuclear fusion. This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, only lasted for about 17 minutes and
                            ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred. About 25% of the protons and
                            all the neutrons in the universe, by mass, were converted to helium, with small amounts of deuterium (a form of hydrogen) and
                            traces of lithium. Any other element was only formed in very tiny quantities. The other 75% of the protons remained unaffected,
                            as hydrogen nuclei.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After nucleosynthesis ended, the universe entered a period known as the photon epoch. During this period,
                            the universe was still far too hot for matter to form neutral atoms, so it contained a hot, dense,
                            foggy plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. After about 377,000 years,
                            the universe had cooled enough that electrons and nuclei could form the first stable atoms. This is known as
                            recombination for historical reasons; in fact electrons and nuclei were combining for the first time. Unlike plasma,
                            neutral atoms are transparent to many wavelengths of light, so for the first time the universe also became transparent.
                            The photons released ("decoupled") when these atoms formed can still be seen today; they form the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

                        <p>
                            As the universe expands, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because
                            the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. At around 47,000 years, the energy density of matter became larger than
                            that of photons and neutrinos, and began to dominate the large scale behavior of the universe. This marked the end of
                            the radiation-dominated era and the start of the matter-dominated era.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the earliest stages of the universe, tiny fluctuations within the universe's density led to concentrations of
                            dark matter gradually forming. Ordinary matter, attracted to these by gravity, formed large gas clouds and eventually,
                            stars and galaxies, where the dark matter was most dense, and voids where it was least dense. After around 100 - 300 million years,
                            the first stars formed, known as Population III stars. These were probably very massive, luminous, non metallic and short-lived.
                            They were responsible for the gradual reionization of the universe between about 200-500 million years and 1 billion years,
                            and also for seeding the universe with elements heavier than helium, through stellar nucleosynthesis.
                            The universe also contains a mysterious energy—possibly a scalar field—called dark energy, the density of
                            which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the universe had expanded sufficiently so that
                            the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era.
                            In this era, the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to dark energy.

                            Of the four fundamental interactions, gravitation is the dominant at astronomical length scales. Gravity's effects are cumulative;
                            by contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism
                            relatively insignificant on astronomical length scales. The remaining two interactions, the weak and strong nuclear forces,
                            decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.

                            The universe appears to have much more matter than antimatter, an asymmetry possibly related to the CP violation.
                            This imbalance between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the existence of all matter existing today,
                            since matter and antimatter, if equally produced at the Big Bang, would have completely annihilated each other and
                            left only photons as a result of their interaction. The universe also appears to have neither net momentum nor angular momentum,
                            which follows accepted physical laws if the universe is finite. These laws are Gauss's law and the non-divergence of
                            the stress-energy-momentum pseudotensor.

                            The size of the universe is somewhat difficult to define. According to the general theory of relativity, far regions of
                            space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the universe due to the finite speed of light and
                            the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space,
                            even if the universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Distant regions of space are assumed to exist and to be part of reality as much as we are,
                            even though we can never interact with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is
                            the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling,
                            an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still.
                            Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler will not be able to interact with all of space. Typically,
                            the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the universe that is observable
                            from our vantage point in the Milky Way.

                            The proper distance—the distance as would be measured at a specific time, including the present—between Earth and
                            the edge of the observable universe is 46 billion light-years (14 billion parsecs),
                            making the diameter of the observable universe about 93 billion light-years (28 billion parsecs).
                            The distance the light from the edge of the observable universe has travelled is very close to the age of
                            the universe times the speed of light, 13.8 billion light-years (4.2×109 pc), but this does not represent
                            the distance at any given time because the edge of the observable universe and the Earth have since moved
                            further apart. For comparison, the diameter of a typical galaxy is 30,000 light-years (9,198 parsecs),
                            and the typical distance between two neighboring galaxies is 3 million light-years (919.8 kiloparsecs).
                            As an example, the Milky Way is roughly 100,000–180,000 light-years in diameter, and the nearest sister galaxy to
                            the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, is located roughly 2.5 million light-years away.

                            Because we cannot observe space beyond the edge of the observable universe, it is unknown whether the size of
                            the universe in its totality is finite or infinite. Estimates for the total size of the universe, if finite,
                            reach as high as {\displaystyle 10^{10^{10^{122}}}}10^{10^{10^{122}}} megaparsecs, implied by
                            one resolution of the No-Boundary Proposal.

                            Astronomers calculate the age of the universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform,
                            hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically
                            and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes
                            the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including
                            the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing
                            and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present.
                            Assuming that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield
                            a best value of the age of the universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.

                            Over time, the universe and its contents have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed
                            and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light-years away even though
                            that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion is consistent with the observation that
                            the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey.
                            Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.

                            The more matter there is in the universe, the stronger the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the universe were too dense then
                            it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the universe contained too little matter then the self-gravity would be too weak
                            for astronomical structures, like galaxies or planets, to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly,
                            our universe has just the right mass-energy density, equivalent to about 5 protons per cubic metre, which has allowed it to expand for
                            the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.

                            There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, it was expected that
                            the expansion rate would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the universe; and thus there is
                            an additional observable quantity in the universe called the deceleration parameter, which most cosmologists expected to be positive and
                            related to the matter density of the universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be negative,
                            approximately -0.55, which technically implies that the second derivative of the cosmic scale factor {\displaystyle {\ddot {a}}}{\displaystyle {\ddot {a}}}
                            has been positive in the last 5-6 billion years. This acceleration does not, however, imply that the Hubble parameter is currently increasing;
                            see deceleration parameter for details.
