                            A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation
                            such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform
                            spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon.
                            Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it,
                            it has no locally detectable features. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.
                            Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation,
                            with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature
                            is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.

                            Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century
                            by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize
                            a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from
                            which nothing can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in 1958. Black holes were long considered
                            a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction
                            of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest
                            in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality.

                            Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle.
                            After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings.
                            By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of
                            solar masses (M☉) may form. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation
                            such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction,
                            forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to
                            a supermassive black hole can be shred into streamers that shine very brightly before being "swallowed."
                            If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location.
                            Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way,
                            astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems, and established that
                            the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole
                            of about 4.3 million solar masses.

                            On 11 February 2016, the LIGO collaboration announced the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which also represented
                            the first observation of a black hole merger. As of December 2018, eleven gravitational wave events have been observed that
                            originated from ten merging black holes (along with one binary neutron star merger). On 10 April 2019,
                            the first ever direct image of a black hole and its vicinity was published, following observations made by
                            the Event Horizon Telescope in 2017 of the supermassive black hole in Messier 87's galactic centre.

                            The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by astronomical pioneer and
                            English clergyman John Michell in a letter published in November 1784. Michell's simplistic calculations assumed such
                            a body might have the same density as the Sun, and concluded that such a body would form when a star's diameter exceeds
                            the Sun's by a factor of 500, and the surface escape velocity exceeds the usual speed of light. Michell correctly noted
                            that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their gravitational effects on
                            nearby visible bodies. Scholars of the time were initially excited by the proposal that giant but invisible stars
                            might be hiding in plain view, but enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of light became apparent in
                            the early nineteenth century.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If light were a wave rather than a "corpuscle", it is unclear what, if any, influence gravity would have on
                            escaping light waves. Modern physics discredits Michell's notion of a light ray shooting directly from the surface of
                            a supermassive star, being slowed down by the star's gravity, stopping, and then free-falling back to the star's surface.

                        <p>
                            In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his theory of general relativity, having earlier shown that gravity does influence
                            light's motion. Only a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild found a solution to the Einstein field equations,
                            which describes the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass. A few months after Schwarzschild,
                            Johannes Droste, a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave the same solution for the point mass and
                            wrote more extensively about its properties. This solution had a peculiar behaviour at what is now called
                            the Schwarzschild radius, where it became singular, meaning that some of the terms in the Einstein equations became infinite.
                            The nature of this surface was not quite understood at the time. In 1924, Arthur Eddington showed that
                            the singularity disappeared after a change of coordinates (see Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates),
                            although it took until 1933 for Georges Lemaître to realize that this meant the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was
                            a non-physical coordinate singularity. Arthur Eddington did however comment on the possibility of a star with
                            mass compressed to the Schwarzschild radius in a 1926 book, noting that Einstein's theory allows us to rule out overly
                            large densities for visible stars like Betelgeuse because "a star of 250 million km radius could not possibly have so high
                            a density as the sun. Firstly, the force of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to escape from it,
                            the rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth. Secondly, the red shift of the spectral lines would be so great that
                            the spectrum would be shifted out of existence. Thirdly, the mass would produce so much curvature of the space-time metric that
                            space would close up around the star, leaving us outside (i.e., nowhere)."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1931, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar calculated, using special relativity, that a non-rotating body of electron-degenerate matter above
                            a certain limiting mass (now called the Chandrasekhar limit at 1.4 M☉) has no stable solutions. His arguments were opposed by
                            many of his contemporaries like Eddington and Lev Landau, who argued that some yet unknown mechanism would stop the collapse.
                            They were partly correct: a white dwarf slightly more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a neutron star,
                            which is itself stable. But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and others predicted that neutron stars above another limit
                            (the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit) would collapse further for the reasons presented by Chandrasekhar, and concluded that
                            no law of physics was likely to intervene and stop at least some stars from collapsing to black holes.
                            Their original calculations, based on the Pauli exclusion principle, gave it as 0.7 M☉; subsequent consideration of strong
                            force-mediated neutron-neutron repulsion raised the estimate to approximately 1.5 M☉ to 3.0 M☉.
                            Observations of the neutron star merger GW170817, which is thought to have generated a black hole shortly afterward,
                            have refined the TOV limit estimate to ~2.17 M☉.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that
                            this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers,
                            but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called "frozen stars",
                            because an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it to
                            the Schwarzschild radius.

                        <p>
                            In 1958, David Finkelstein identified the Schwarzschild surface as an event horizon, "a perfect unidirectional membrane:
                            causal influences can cross it in only one direction". This did not strictly contradict Oppenheimer's results,
                            but extended them to include the point of view of infalling observers. Finkelstein's solution extended
                            the Schwarzschild solution for the future of observers falling into a black hole. A complete extension had already been found
                            by Martin Kruskal, who was urged to publish it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These results came at the beginning of the golden age of general relativity, which was marked by general relativity
                            and black holes becoming mainstream subjects of research. This process was helped by the discovery of pulsars by
                            Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967, which, by 1969, were shown to be rapidly rotating neutron stars.
                            Until that time, neutron stars, like black holes, were regarded as just theoretical curiosities;
                            but the discovery of pulsars showed their physical relevance and spurred a further interest in all types of
                            compact objects that might be formed by gravitational collapse.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this period more general black hole solutions were found. In 1963, Roy Kerr found the exact solution for
                            a rotating black hole. Two years later, Ezra Newman found the axisymmetric solution for a black hole that
                            is both rotating and electrically charged. Through the work of Werner Israel, Brandon Carter,
                            and David Robinson the no-hair theorem emerged, stating that a stationary black hole solution is completely described by
                            the three parameters of the Kerr–Newman metric: mass, angular momentum, and electric charge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At first, it was suspected that the strange features of the black hole solutions were pathological artifacts from
                            the symmetry conditions imposed, and that the singularities would not appear in generic situations.
                            This view was held in particular by Vladimir Belinsky, Isaak Khalatnikov, and Evgeny Lifshitz, who tried to prove that
                            no singularities appear in generic solutions. However, in the late 1960s Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking
                            used global techniques to prove that singularities appear generically.

                            Work by James Bardeen, Jacob Bekenstein, Carter, and Hawking in the early 1970s led to the formulation of black hole thermodynamics.
                            These laws describe the behaviour of a black hole in close analogy to the laws of thermodynamics by relating mass to energy,
                            area to entropy, and surface gravity to temperature. The analogy was completed when Hawking, in 1974,
                            showed that quantum field theory implies that black holes should radiate like a black body with a temperature proportional to
                            the surface gravity of the black hole, predicting the effect now known as Hawking radiation.

                            John Michell used the term "dark star", and in the early 20th century, physicists used the term "gravitationally collapsed object".
                            Science writer Marcia Bartusiak traces the term "black hole" to physicist Robert H. Dicke, who in the early 1960s reportedly compared
                            the phenomenon to the Black Hole of Calcutta, notorious as a prison where people entered but never left alive.

                            The term "black hole" was used in print by Life and Science News magazines in 1963, and by science journalist Ann Ewing in her article
                            "'Black Holes' in Space", dated 18 January 1964, which was a report on a meeting of the American Association for

                            its brevity and "advertising value", and it quickly caught on, leading some to credit Wheeler with coining the phrase.

                            The no-hair conjecture postulates that, once it achieves a stable condition after formation, a black hole has only
                            three independent physical properties: mass, charge, and angular momentum; the black hole is otherwise featureless.
                            If the conjecture is true, any two black holes that share the same values for these properties, or parameters,
                            are indistinguishable from one another. The degree to which the conjecture is true for real black holes under
                            the laws of modern physics, is currently an unsolved problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These properties are special because they are visible from outside a black hole. For example, a charged black hole repels
                            other like charges just like any other charged object. Similarly, the total mass inside a sphere containing
                            a black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of Gauss's law, the ADM mass, far away from the black hole.
                            Likewise, the angular momentum can be measured from far away using frame dragging by the gravitomagnetic field.

                        <p>
                            When an object falls into a black hole, any information about the shape of the object or distribution
                            of charge on it is evenly distributed along the horizon of the black hole, and is lost to outside observers.
                            The behavior of the horizon in this situation is a dissipative system that is closely analogous to that of
                            a conductive stretchy membrane with friction and electrical resistance—the membrane paradigm.
                            This is different from other field theories such as electromagnetism, which do not have any friction or
                            resistivity at the microscopic level, because they are time-reversible. Because a black hole eventually achieves
                            a stable state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about
                            the initial conditions: the gravitational and electric fields of a black hole give very little information about
                            what went in. The information that is lost includes every quantity that cannot be measured far away from
                            the black hole horizon, including approximately conserved quantum numbers such as the total baryon number and
                            lepton number. This behavior is so puzzling that it has been called the black hole information loss paradox.

                            Given the bizarre character of black holes, it was long questioned whether such objects could actually exist in
                            nature or whether they were merely pathological solutions to Einstein's equations.
                            Einstein himself wrongly thought black holes would not form, because he held that the angular momentum of
                            collapsing particles would stabilize their motion at some radius. This led the general relativity
                            community to dismiss all results to the contrary for many years. However, a minority of
                            relativists continued to contend that black holes were physical objects, and by the end of the 1960s, they had persuaded
                            the majority of researchers in the field that there is no obstacle to the formation of an event horizon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Penrose demonstrated that once an event horizon forms, general relativity without quantum mechanics requires that
                            a singularity will form within. Shortly afterwards, Hawking showed that many cosmological solutions that describe
                            the Big Bang have singularities without scalar fields or other exotic matter (see "Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems").
                            The Kerr solution, the no-hair theorem, and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical properties of
                            black holes were simple and comprehensible, making them respectable subjects for research. Conventional black holes are
                            formed by gravitational collapse of heavy objects such as stars, but they can also in theory be formed by other processes.

                        <h3 class="w3-center w3-padding-16 blue-grey-grad" style="margin-top:32px;">Gravitational collapse</h3>
                        <p>
                            Gravitational collapse occurs when an object's internal pressure is insufficient to resist the object's own gravity.
                            For stars this usually occurs either because a star has too little "fuel" left to maintain its temperature through
                            stellar nucleosynthesis, or because a star that would have been stable receives extra matter in a way
                            that does not raise its core temperature. In either case the star's temperature is no longer high enough to prevent it from
                            collapsing under its own weight. The collapse may be stopped by the degeneracy pressure of the star's constituents,
                            allowing the condensation of matter into an exotic denser state. The result is one of the various types of compact star.
                            Which type forms depends on the mass of the remnant of the original star left after the outer layers have been blown away.
                            Such explosions and pulsations lead to planetary nebula. This mass can be substantially less than the original star.
                            Remnants exceeding 5 M☉ are produced by stars that were over 20 M☉ before the collapse.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the mass of the remnant exceeds about 3–4 M☉ (the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit), either because
                            the original star was very heavy or because the remnant collected additional mass through accretion of matter,
                            even the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is insufficient to stop the collapse. No known mechanism
                            (except possibly quark degeneracy pressure, see quark star) is powerful enough to stop the implosion and
                            the object will inevitably collapse to form a black hole.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The gravitational collapse of heavy stars is assumed to be responsible for the formation of stellar mass black holes.
                            Star formation in the early universe may have resulted in very massive stars, which upon their collapse would have produced
                            black holes of up to 103 M☉. These black holes could be the seeds of the supermassive black holes found in the centers of
                            most galaxies. It has further been suggested that supermassive black holes with typical masses of ~105 M☉
                            could have formed from the direct collapse of gas clouds in the young universe. Some candidates for
                            such objects have been found in observations of the young universe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While most of the energy released during gravitational collapse is emitted very quickly, an outside observer does not actually see
                            the end of this process. Even though the collapse takes a finite amount of time from the reference frame of infalling matter,
                            a distant observer would see the infalling material slow and halt just above the event horizon, due to gravitational time dilation.
                            Light from the collapsing material takes longer and longer to reach the observer, with the light emitted just before
                            the event horizon forms delayed an infinite amount of time. Thus the external observer never sees the formation of the event horizon;
                            instead, the collapsing material seems to become dimmer and increasingly red-shifted, eventually fading away.

                            Gravitational collapse is not the only process that could create black holes. In principle,
                            black holes could be formed in high-energy collisions that achieve sufficient density. As of 2002,
                            no such events have been detected, either directly or indirectly as a deficiency of the mass balance in
                            particle accelerator experiments. This suggests that there must be a lower limit for the mass of black holes.
                            Theoretically, this boundary is expected to lie around the Planck mass (mP=√ħ c/G ≈ 1.2×1019 GeV/c2 ≈ 2.2×10−8 kg),
                            where quantum effects are expected to invalidate the predictions of general relativity. This would put
                            the creation of black holes firmly out of reach of any high-energy process occurring on or near the Earth.
                            However, certain developments in quantum gravity suggest that the Planck mass could be much lower:
                            some braneworld scenarios for example put the boundary as low as 1 TeV/c2. This would make it conceivable for
                            micro black holes to be created in the high-energy collisions that occur when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere,
                            or possibly in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. These theories are very speculative, and the creation of black holes
                            in these processes is deemed unlikely by many specialists. Even if micro black holes could be formed,
                            it is expected that they would evaporate in about 10−25 seconds, posing no threat to the Earth.
