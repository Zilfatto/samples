                        <p>
                            A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.
                            The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way.
                            Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million (108) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (1014) stars,
                            each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Many galaxies are
                            thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*,
                            has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with
                            a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Research released in 2016 revised the number of galaxies in the observable universe from a previous estimate of 200 billion
                            (2×1011) to a suggested two trillion (2×1012) or more and, overall, as many as an estimated 1×1024 stars
                            (more stars than all the grains of sand on planet Earth). Most of the galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter
                            (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs).
                            For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 30,000 parsecs (100,000 ly) and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy,
                            its nearest large neighbor, by 780,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.)

                            The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) having an average density of less than
                            one atom per cubic meter. The majority of galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups, clusters, and superclusters.
                            The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which is dominated by it and the Andromeda Galaxy and is part of the Virgo Supercluster.
                            At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids.
                            Both the Local Group and the Virgo Supercluster are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named Laniakea.

                            galaxy types based on their appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely
                            based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as
                            star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.

                        <p>
                            The Hubble classification system rates elliptical galaxies on the basis of their ellipticity, ranging from E0,
                            being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile,
                            giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and
                            they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of
                            open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are dominated by generally older,
                            more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions.
                            The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst.
                            In this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The largest galaxies are giant ellipticals. Many elliptical galaxies are believed to form due to
                            the interaction of galaxies, resulting in a collision and merger.
                            They can grow to enormous sizes (compared to spiral galaxies, for example),
                            and giant elliptical galaxies are often found near the core of large galaxy clusters.

                        <h3 class="w3-center w3-padding-16 blue-grey-grad" style="margin-top:32px;">Shell galaxy</h3>
                        <p>
                            A shell galaxy is a type of elliptical galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo are arranged
                            in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure,
                            which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop
                            when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach,
                            the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples
                            forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example,
                            galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.

                        <p>
                            Spiral galaxies resemble spiraling pinwheels. Though the stars and other visible material contained
                            in such a galaxy lie mostly on a plane, the majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in
                            a roughly spherical halo of dark matter which extends beyond the visible component,
                            as demonstrated by the universal rotation curve concept.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Spiral galaxies consist of a rotating disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with
                            a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms.
                            In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by
                            a letter (a, b, or c) which indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms and the size of
                            the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses
                            a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms
                            and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as
                            a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent
                            and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with
                            the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In spiral galaxies, the spiral arms do have the shape of approximate logarithmic spirals,
                            a pattern that can be theoretically shown to result from a disturbance in
                            a uniformly rotating mass of stars. Like the stars, the spiral arms rotate around the center,
                            but they do so with constant angular velocity. The spiral arms are thought to be areas of
                            high-density matter, or "density waves".[67] As stars move through an arm, the space velocity of
                            each stellar system is modified by the gravitational force of the higher density.
                            (The velocity returns to normal after the stars depart on the other side of the arm.)
                            This effect is akin to a "wave" of slowdowns moving along a highway full of moving cars.
                            The arms are visible because the high density facilitates star formation, and therefore
                            they harbor many bright and young stars.

                        <p>
                            A majority of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear,
                            bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward to either side of the core, then merges into
                            the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB,
                            followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) which indicates the form of the spiral arms
                            (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures
                            that can occur as a result of a density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to
                            a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as
                            a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is a large disk-shaped barred-spiral galaxy about 30 kiloparsecs
                            in diameter and a kiloparsec thick. It contains about two hundred billion (2×1011) stars and
                            has a total mass of about six hundred billion (6×1011) times the mass of the Sun.

                        <p>
                            Recently, researchers described galaxies called super-luminous spirals. They are very large with
                            an upward diameter of 437,000 light-years (compared to the Milky Way's 100,000 light-year diameter).
                            With a mass of 340 billion solar masses, they generate a significant amount of ultraviolet and
                            mid-infrared light. They are thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster
                            than the Milky Way.

                                A ring galaxy has a ring-like structure of stars and interstellar medium surrounding a bare core.
                                A ring galaxy is thought to occur when a smaller galaxy passes through the core of a spiral galaxy.
                                Such an event may have affected the Andromeda Galaxy, as it displays a multi-ring-like structure
                                when viewed in infrared radiation.

                                A lenticular galaxy is an intermediate form that has properties of both elliptical and spiral galaxies.
                                These are categorized as Hubble type S0, and they possess ill-defined spiral arms with
                                an elliptical halo of stars (barred lenticular galaxies receive Hubble classification SB0.)

                                Irr-II galaxies do not possess any structure that resembles a Hubble classification, and may have been disrupted.

                                An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be the same size as the Milky Way
                                but has a visible star count only one percent of the Milky Way. The lack of luminosity is because there is
                                a lack of star-forming gas in it, which results in old stellar populations.

                            Despite the prominence of large elliptical and spiral galaxies, most galaxies are dwarf galaxies. These galaxies are
                            relatively small when compared with other galactic formations, being about one hundredth the size of the Milky Way,
                            containing only a few billion stars. Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies have recently been discovered that are only 100 parsecs across.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many dwarf galaxies may orbit a single larger galaxy; the Milky Way has at least a dozen such satellites, with
                            an estimated 300–500 yet to be discovered.[82] Dwarf galaxies may also be classified as elliptical, spiral,
                            or irregular. Since small dwarf ellipticals bear little resemblance to large ellipticals, they are often called
                            dwarf spheroidal galaxies instead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A study of 27 Milky Way neighbors found that in all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is approximately 10 million solar masses,
                            regardless of whether the galaxy has thousands or millions of stars. This has led to the suggestion that galaxies are
                            largely formed by dark matter, and that the minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter incapable of
                            gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.
