            <h3 class="w3-center">My little story</h3>
            <p>
                After graduating from high school, I did not know what career I wanted. By that time I had a dream to be
                fluent in English and
                go to America some day, but I did not take any actions for making this come true. So I did what my
                parents told me to do.
                I went to university for studying Specialistâ€™s degree program of &#8220;Mining and underground
                constructions&#8221; because my parents considered that profession to be quite high-paying or
                at least I would have a Specialist's degree which gives me the experience and opportunities for life.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day, at the end of my freshman year I started thinking about my life, dreams and future, and
                realised that,
                if I continued to go through life in the same way, I would never live my dreams. Nothing would change in
                my life without taking actions towards my dreams.
                Also it became clear to me that education in most Russian universities was quite poor, and yes, the
                university would give me a degree, but would not give much knowledge.
                For these reasons, I started my self-education journey by learning English, and now as you can see,
                there is a progress in it.
            </p>
            <p>
                About a year ago, I found my true passion, and it was programming. Since then, I became completely
                obsessed with it. So far, I have completed <a class="source" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/"
                    target="_blank">CS50x</a>
                course (Computer Science 50 at Harvard University), <a class="source" href="https://www.w3schools.com/"
                    target="_blank">w3schools</a>'s tutorials on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, W3.CSS (CSS framework from
                w3schools), SASS and React. Currently I am taking
                <a class="source" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/" target="_blank">CS50 Web Programming</a>
                course, and that is only the beginning.
            </p>
            <h3 class="w3-center">My mindset</h3>
            <div style="padding:16px 0;">
                Please, do not believe, if I was born in this country, it means that I have the same polotical views as
                most Russians.
                To be honest, I do not like this country because the authorities are very corrupted, and also my mindset
                is quite different from most people here.
                <h3 id="about">I -</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>am always open-minded.</li>
                    <li>think there is one thing that we all have in common, it is the Earth - our Home, and the
                        boundaries are only in our minds.</li>
                    <li>want we all to build bridges for our common good, not walls.</li>
                    <li>did not choose where I wanted to be born, and so I think that at least we all have to be able to
                        choose where we want to live.</li>
                    <li>am not a very religious person.</li>
                    <li>do not drink.</li>
                    <li>have been going to the gym for 7 years (almost every day).</li>
                    <li>am always curious about the world.</li>
                    <li>seek to improve myself and never miss an occasion to learn something new.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    With regard to my desire like a citizen, I really want to live in a truly democratic country with
                    free and fair elections,
                    good health care and education, and free mass media, where freedom is a sacred right.
                </p>
                In my view, life long education is an essential part of our life, because we live in a fast-changing
                world and need to be adaptive.
                So, if you want to stay afloat for a long time, it demands putting some of your time and effort into
                developing yourself. But first, it is important to follow your heart and
                find your true passion for moving in the right direction. The best motivation to continue doing
                something is your own progress in it, but the hardest thing is to get started.
                I clearly remember when I started learning English or programming for the first time and the most
                difficult part was just to get started. But every time I compare my today's version of myself with
                that old one, it makes me feel so good that I want to put more and more energy, effort and time into
                further improvement these skills. A few years ago I could only dream about being able to write and
                speak in English or creating a website, but now it is the reality.
            </div>
            <h3 class="w3-center">My project</h3>
            <h4 class="w3-margin-left">Why did I choose this subject?</h4>
            <p>
                Firstly, I am not so good in English for writing perfect articles and secondly, I made it for showing my
                developer's skills, but not copywriter's ones.
                So I was finding subjects where I did not need to generate most of the text content by myself and could
                just copy and paste it. (and of course sources that were available for non-commercial using)
            </p>
            <h4 class="w3-margin-left">What I did not do in it or did wrong</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I started creating first pages for &#8220;desktop first&#8221;, then realised that it was not the
                    best decision, but it was quite late for changing it because it would take quite a lot of time.
                    So I left it as it was.</li>
                <li>I did not find any ways for caching only images in Flask, so they are always loading.</li>
                <li>I used a jpeg format for images, but there are next-gen ones for better compression. I needed to
                    convert copies of that images to WebP format and add links to them to a picture HTML elements,
                    but it also would take quite a lot of time.</li>
                <li>I did not reduce the size of all files using popular bundler - Webpack, because I wanted to let
                    all visitiors see the source code not only going to the GitHub, but also directly from the current
                    page</li>
                <li>I did not provide support of modern JavaScript for all browsers, because at the moment of bulding
                    this project I was not
                    so familliar with the technology like Babel. May be in the future, when I have enough free time, I
                    will fix that.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="w3-margin-left">My web app is not for the production, so I only write about these details here in
                order to say that I have an understanding of it.</p>
            <p>All HTML and CSS in my project successfully passed the validation on <a
                    href="https://validator.w3.org/">Markup Validation Service</a> and
                support all modern browsers starting from IE10.
                But there is one subtle - I implemented loading some images after the body has loaded or a user has
                scolled curtain place on the page using JavaScript.head-img
                To achieve this I needed to remove "href" attributes from &#60;img&#62; elements</p>
            <h3 class="w3-center">About my programming experience, skills and future job</h3>
            <ul>
                <h4 class="w3-margin-top">I have:</h4>
                <li>experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, SASS, Git and not so much with Python, Flask and SQL.</li>
                <li>a basic understanding of software development and programming languages.</li>
                <li>a thorough knowledge of computer science fundamentals (algorithms and data structures).</li>
                <li>the ability to write clean and maintainable code, following standards and guidelines.</li>
                <h4 class="w3-margin-top">I am:</h4>
                <li>a team player and like to collaborate with other people.</li>
                <li>highly motivated and have a passion for creating and supporting great products.</li>
                <li>great at efficient problem solving.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On my <a class="source" href="https://github.com/Zilfatto/samples" target="_blank">github repository</a>
                you can find samples of my code.</p>
            <p>Taking CS50, I implemented merge sort in C for an array of integers already in the fourth week of that
                course. Creating this project, for finding a country (ies) in the most efficient way on a register page
                for an autocomplete,
                I implemented binary search. I am always striving to make something in the best possible way and paying
                great
                attention to details.</p>
            <p>Although, I am currently a fourth-year student, there is no any reason for me to continue going to
                university because my program does not have anything to do with IT,
                a degree itself does not make much sense here in Russia and I found an alternative way for getting
                education using my English skills and the internet. For me, there is a big difference
                in the quality of education between foreign and local one. So I am ready to go on extramural education
                or drop out at any time when I
                get my first job offer.</p>
            <p>I want to find an ambitious team for which only sky is the limit and also make a contribution to the
                development of a company, by working on big projects.</p>
