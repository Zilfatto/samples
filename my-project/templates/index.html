                            Humans have always looked at the heavens and wondered about the nature of the objects seen in the night sky.
                            With the development of rockets and the advances in electronics and other technologies in the 20th century,
                            it became possible to send machines and animals and then people above Earth’s atmosphere into outer space.
                            Well before technology made these achievements possible, however, space exploration had already captured
                            the minds of many people, not only aircraft pilots and scientists but also writers and artists.
                            The strong hold that space travel has always had on the imagination may well explain why professional astronauts
                            and laypeople alike consent at their great peril, in the words of Tom Wolfe in The Right Stuff (1979),
                            to sit “on top of an enormous Roman candle, such as a Redstone, Atlas, Titan or Saturn rocket,
                            and wait for someone to light the fuse.” It perhaps also explains why space exploration has been a common
                            and enduring theme in literature and art. As centuries of speculative fiction in books and more recently
                            in films make clear, “one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind” was taken by the human spirit many times
                            and in many ways before Neil Armstrong stamped humankind’s first footprint on the Moon.

                            Achieving spaceflight enabled humans to begin to explore the solar system and the rest of the universe,
                            to understand the many objects and phenomena that are better observed from a space perspective,
                            and to use for human benefit the resources and attributes of the space environment.
                            All of these activities — discovery, scientific understanding, and the application of that understanding
                            to serve human purposes — are elements of space exploration.

                            The Andromeda Galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years (770 kiloparsecs)
                            from Earth, and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. The galaxy's name stems from the area of
                            the Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which itself is named after the Ethiopian
                            (or Phoenician) princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek Mythology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are expected to collide in around 4.5 billion years, merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy
                            or a large lenticular galaxy. With an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy is among the brightest of the Messier objects
                            making it visible to the naked eye from Earth on moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around the year 964, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi was the first to describe the Andromeda Galaxy.
                            He referred to it in his Book of Fixed Stars as a "nebulous smear".

                            The Whirlpool Galaxy, also known as Messier 51a, M51a, and NGC 5194, is an interacting grand-design spiral galaxy
                            with a Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus. It lies in the constellation Canes Venatici, and was
                            the first galaxy to be classified as a spiral galaxy. Its distance is estimated to be 23 million light-years away from Earth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The galaxy and its companion, NGC 5195, are easily observed by amateur astronomers, and the two galaxies may be seen with binoculars.
                            The Whirlpool Galaxy has been extensively observed by professional astronomers, who study it to understand galaxy structure
                            (particularly structure associated with the spiral arms) and galaxy interactions.

                        <p>
                            What later became known as the Whirlpool Galaxy was discovered on October 13, 1773, by Charles Messier while hunting for objects
                             that could confuse comet hunters, and was designated in Messier's catalogue as M51.

                            Although the possibility of exploring space has long excited people in many walks of life,
                            for most of the latter 20th century and into the early 21st century,
                            only national governments could afford the very high costs of launching people and machines into space.
                            This reality meant that space exploration had to serve very broad interests,
                            and it indeed has done so in a variety of ways. Government space programs have increased knowledge,
                            served as indicators of national prestige and power, enhanced national security and military strength,
                            and provided significant benefits to the general public. In areas where the private sector could profit
                            from activities in space, most notably the use of satellites as telecommunication relays,
                            commercial space activity has flourished without government funding. In the early 21st century,
                            entrepreneurs believed that there were several other areas of commercial potential in space,
                            most notably privately funded space travel.
                        </p>

                            In the years after World War II, governments assumed a leading role in the support of research that increased
                            fundamental knowledge about nature, a role that earlier had been played by universities, private foundations,
                            and other nongovernmental supporters. This change came for two reasons. First, the need for
                            complex equipment to carry out many scientific experiments and for the large teams of researchers to use
                            that equipment led to costs that only governments could afford. Second, governments were willing to take
                            on this responsibility because of the belief that fundamental research would produce new knowledge essential to the health,
                            the security, and the quality of life of their citizens. Thus, when scientists sought government support for early space experiments,
                            it was forthcoming. Since the start of space efforts in the United States, the Soviet Union, and Europe,
                            national governments have given high priority to the support of science done in and from space. From modest beginnings,
                            space science has expanded under government support to include multibillion-dollar exploratory missions in the solar system.
                            Examples of such efforts include the development of the Curiosity Mars rover, the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn and its moons,
                            and the development of major space-based astronomical observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope.

                            Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1957 used the fact that his country had been first to launch a satellite as evidence of
                            the technological power of the Soviet Union and of the superiority of communism. He repeated these claims after Yuri Gagarin’s
                            orbital flight in 1961. Although U.S. Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower had decided not to compete for prestige with the Soviet Union in a space race,
                            his successor, John F. Kennedy, had a different view. On April 20, 1961, in the aftermath of the Gagarin flight, he asked his advisers
                            to identify a “space program which promises dramatic results in which we could win.” The response came in a May 8, 1961, memorandum recommending
                            that the United States commit to sending people to the Moon, because “dramatic achievements in space…symbolize the technological power and
                            organizing capacity of a nation” and because the ensuing prestige would be “part of the battle along the fluid front of the cold war.”
                            From 1961 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, competition between the United States and
                            the Soviet Union was a major influence on the pace and content of their space programs. Other countries also viewed having
                            a successful space program as an important indicator of national strength.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even before the first satellite was launched, U.S. leaders recognized that the ability to observe military activities around the world from space
                            would be an asset to national security. Following on the success of its photoreconnaissance satellites, which began operation in 1960,
                            the United States built increasingly complex observation and electronic-intercept intelligence satellites.
                            The Soviet Union also quickly developed an array of intelligence satellites, and later a few other countries instituted their own
                            satellite observation programs. Intelligence-gathering satellites have been used to verify arms-control agreements, provide warnings of
                            military threats, and identify targets during military operations, among other uses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to providing security benefits, satellites offered military forces the potential for improved communications, weather observation,
                            navigation, timing, and position location. This led to significant government funding for military space programs in the United States and
                            the Soviet Union. Although the advantages and disadvantages of stationing force-delivery weapons in space have been debated,
                            as of the early 21st century, such weapons had not been deployed, nor had space-based antisatellite systems—that is, systems that can attack or
                            interfere with orbiting satellites. The stationing of weapons of mass destruction in orbit or
                            on celestial bodies is prohibited by international law.

                            Governments realized early on that the ability to observe Earth from space could provide significant benefits to the general public apart
                            from security and military uses. The first application to be pursued was the development of satellites for assisting in weather forecasting.
                            A second application involved remote observation of land and sea surfaces to gather imagery and other data of value in crop forecasting,
                            resource management, environmental monitoring, and other applications. The U.S., the Soviet Union, Europe, and China also developed their own
                            satellite-based global positioning systems, originally for military purposes, that could pinpoint a user’s exact location, help in navigating
                            from one point to another, and provide very precise time signals. These satellites quickly found numerous civilian uses in such areas
                            as personal navigation, surveying and cartography, geology, air-traffic control, and the operation of information-transfer networks.
                            They illustrate a reality that has remained constant for a half century—as space capabilities are developed,
                            they often can be used for both military and civilian purposes.

                            Another space application that began under government sponsorship but quickly moved into the private sector is the relay of voice, video,
                            and data via orbiting satellites. Satellite telecommunications has developed into a multibillion-dollar business and is
                            the one clearly successful area of commercial space activity. A related, but economically much smaller, commercial space business is
                            the provision of launches for private and government satellites. In 2004 a privately financed venture sent a piloted spacecraft,
                            SpaceShipOne, to the lower edge of space for three brief suborbital flights. Although it was technically a much less challenging achievement
                            than carrying humans into orbit, its success was seen as an important step toward opening up space to commercial travel
                            and eventually to tourism. More than 15 years after SpaceShipOne reached space, several firms were poised to carry out such suborbital flights.
                            Companies have arisen that also use satellite imagery to provide data for business about economic trends. Suggestions have been made that
                            in the future other areas of space activity, including using resources found on the Moon and near-Earth asteroids and
                            the capture of solar energy to provide electric power on Earth, could become successful businesses.

                            Most space activities have been pursued because they serve some utilitarian purpose, whether increasing knowledge, adding to national power,
                            or making a profit. Nevertheless, there remains a powerful underlying sense that it is important for humans to explore space for its own sake,
                            “to see what is there.” Although the only voyages that humans have made away from the near vicinity of Earth—the Apollo flights
                            to the Moon—were motivated by Cold War competition, there have been recurrent calls for humans to return to the Moon, travel to Mars,
                            and visit other locations in the solar system and beyond. Until humans resume such journeys of exploration,
                            robotic spacecraft will continue to serve in their stead to explore the solar system and probe the mysteries of the universe.
