                        <p>
                            Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System,
                            it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
                            Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and
                            physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
                            Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi).
                            It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆,
                            a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than
                            by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was
                            subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. The position of Neptune was subsequently calculated from Bouvard's observations,
                            independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier after his death. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846
                            by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter,
                            though none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it
                            a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2,
                            when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit Neptune. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and
                            large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen,
                            though it contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia and methane. However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and
                            rock; Uranus and Neptune are normally considered "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction. Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for
                            the planet's blue appearance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of
                            the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. These weather patterns are driven by
                            the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). Because of its great distance from
                            the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C; −361 °F).
                            Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300 °F). Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled "arcs"),
                            which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by Voyager 2.

                            From its discovery in 1846 until the discovery of Pluto in 1930, Neptune was the farthest known planet. When Pluto was discovered, it was considered a planet,
                            and Neptune thus became the second-farthest known planet, except for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it closer
                            than Neptune to the Sun. The discovery of the Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the Kuiper belt.
                            In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined the word "planet" for the first time, reclassifying Pluto as a "dwarf planet" and
                            making Neptune once again the outermost known planet in the Solar System.

                            Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and
                            extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core, where it reaches pressures of about 10 GPa,
                            or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in
                            the lower regions of the atmosphere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane. As is customary in planetary science,
                            this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot, dense fluid. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity,
                            is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean. The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down
                            into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises
                            but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice. At a depth of 7,000 km, the conditions may be such
                            that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones. Scientists also believe that
                            this kind of diamond rain occurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Very-high-pressure experiments at
                            the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the top of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon
                            with floating solid 'diamonds'.

                            The core of Neptune is likely composed of iron, nickel and silicates, with an interior model giving a mass about 1.2 times that of Earth.
                            The pressure at the centre is 7 Mbar (700 GPa), about twice as high as that at the centre of Earth, and the temperature may be 5,400 K.

                            At high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium. A trace amount of methane is also present.
                            Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus,
                            this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue, although Neptune's vivid azure differs
                            from Uranus's milder cyan. Because Neptune's atmospheric methane content is similar to that of Uranus,
                            some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune's colour.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Neptune's atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions: the lower troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere,
                            where temperature increases with altitude. The boundary between the two, the tropopause, lies at a pressure of 0.1 bars (10 kPa). The stratosphere
                            then gives way to the thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10−5 to 10−4 bars (1 to 10 Pa). The thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Models suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude. The upper-level clouds lie
                            at pressures below one bar, where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense. For pressures between one and five bars (100 and 500 kPa),
                            clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form. Above a pressure of five bars, the clouds may consist of ammonia, ammonium sulfide,
                            hydrogen sulfide and water. Deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about 50 bars (5.0 MPa),
                            where the temperature reaches 273 K (0 °C). Underneath, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            High-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands
                            that wrap around the planet at constant latitude. These circumferential bands have widths of 50–150 km and lie about 50–110 km above the cloud deck.
                            These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere.
                            Unlike Uranus, Neptune's composition has a higher volume of ocean, whereas Uranus has a smaller mantle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Neptune's spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane,
                            such as ethane and ethyne. The stratosphere is also home to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer
                            than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For reasons that remain obscure, the planet's thermosphere is at an anomalously high temperature of about 750 K. The planet is too far from the Sun for
                            this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field.
                            Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water,
                            which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.
