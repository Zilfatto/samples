                             Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.
                             It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth
                             the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.
                             Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture;
                             its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds).
                            Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen
                            and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals
                            in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise
                            to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than the Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times
                            that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.
                            The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear.
                            Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter,
                            but not as high as those on Neptune. In January 2019, astronomers reported that a day on the planet

                            The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice particles,
                            with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons are known to orbit Saturn,
                            of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings.
                            Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury,
                            although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.

                            Saturn is a gas giant because it is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface,
                            though it may have a solid core. Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is,
                            it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%:
                            60,268 km versus 54,364 km. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System,
                            are also oblate but to a lesser extent. The combination of the bulge and rotation rate means that
                            the effective surface gravity along the equator, 8.96 m/s2, is 74% that at the poles and is lower than
                            the surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial escape velocity of nearly 36 km/s
                            is much higher than that for Earth.
                        </p>
                              Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less.
                              Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet
                              is 0.69 g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times Earth's mass, and Saturn is 95 times Earth's mass.
                              Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.

                        <p>
                            Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the gas phase,
                            because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at
                            a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure,
                            and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core,
                            which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Standard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter,
                            having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of various volatiles.
                            This core is similar in composition to Earth, but is more dense. The examination of Saturn's gravitational moment,
                            in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core.
                            In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of Earth, which corresponds to a diameter
                            of about 25,000 km. This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of
                            helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude.
                            The outermost layer spans 1,000 km and consists of gas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Saturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700 °C at its core, and it radiates 2.5 times more energy into space
                            than it receives from the Sun. Jupiter's thermal energy is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism of
                            slow gravitational compression, but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn,
                            because it is less massive. An alternative or additional mechanism may be generation of heat through
                            the "raining out" of droplets of helium deep in Saturn's interior. As the droplets descend through
                            the lower-density hydrogen, the process releases heat by friction and leaves Saturn's outer layers depleted of helium.
                            These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core.
                            Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur within Saturn, as well as in Jupiter and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.

                            The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume. The proportion of helium
                            is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun. The quantity of elements heavier than
                            helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from
                            the formation of the Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19–31 times
                            the mass of the Earth, with a significant fraction located in Saturn's core region.

                            Trace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine and methane have been detected in Saturn's atmosphere.
                            The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of
                            either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis
                            in the upper atmosphere, leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with
                            the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by
                            Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.

                            Saturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique. The rings extend
                            from 6,630 to 120,700 kilometers (4,120 to 75,000 mi) outward from Saturn's equator and
                            average approximately 20 meters (66 ft) in thickness. They are composed predominantly of water ice with
                            trace amounts of tholin impurities, and a peppered coating of approximately 7% amorphous carbon.
                            The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10 m.
                            While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of the rings. One hypothesis is that
                            the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from
                            the original nebular material from which Saturn was formed. Some ice in the E ring comes from
                            the moon Enceladus's geysers. The water abundance of the rings varies radially,
                            with the outermost ring A being the most pure in ice water.
                            This abundance variance may be explained by meteor bombardment.

                            Beyond the main rings at a distance of 12 million km from the planet is the sparse Phoebe ring,
                            which is tilted at an angle of 27° to the other rings and, like Phoebe, orbits in retrograde fashion.

                        <p>
                            Some of the moons of Saturn, including Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons to confine the rings
                            and prevent them from spreading out. Pan and Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn's rings
                            that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses.
