                            Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System.
                            It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°.
                            This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time,
                            it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases,
                            similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the fixed stars,
                            it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion,
                            it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1⁄30 degree). Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System;
                            at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and
                            is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat,
                            it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F)
                            during the day across the equatorial regions.[18] The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). The planet has no known natural satellites.

                            Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975; and MESSENGER, launched in 2004, orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years
                            before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet's surface on April 30, 2015. The BepiColombo spacecraft is planned to arrive at Mercury in 2025.

                            Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, iron sulfide outer core layer,
                            a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core.

                            Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like Earth.
                            It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi).
                            Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan.
                            Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material. Mercury's density is the second highest
                            in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less than Earth's density of 5.515 g/cm3. If the effect of
                            gravitational compression were to be factored out from both planets, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser
                            than those of Earth, with an uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth's 4.4 g/cm3.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mercury's density can be used to infer details of its inner structure. Although Earth's high density results appreciably
                            from gravitational compression, particularly at the core, Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed.
                            Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Geologists estimate that Mercury's core occupies about 55% of its volume; for Earth this proportion is 17%.
                            Research published in 2007 suggests that Mercury has a molten core. Surrounding the core is a 500–700 km (310–430 mi) mantle consisting of silicates.
                            Based on data from the Mariner 10 mission and Earth-based observation, Mercury's crust is estimated to be 35 km (22 mi) thick. One distinctive feature
                            of Mercury's surface is the presence of numerous narrow ridges, extending up to several hundred kilometers in length. It is thought that these were
                            formed as Mercury's core and mantle cooled and contracted at a time when the crust had already solidified.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mercury's core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the Solar System, and several theories have been proposed to explain this.
                            The most widely accepted theory is that Mercury originally had a metal–silicate ratio similar to common chondrite meteorites, thought to be typical of
                            the Solar System's rocky matter, and a mass approximately 2.25 times its current mass. Early in the Solar System's history, Mercury may have been struck
                            by a planetesimal of approximately 1/6 that mass and several thousand kilometers across. The impact would have stripped away much of the original crust and mantle,
                            leaving the core behind as a relatively major component. A similar process, known as the giant impact hypothesis, has been proposed to explain the formation of the Moon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alternatively, Mercury may have formed from the solar nebula before the Sun's energy output had stabilized. It would initially have had twice its present mass,
                            but as the protosun contracted, temperatures near Mercury could have been between 2,500 and 3,500 K and possibly even as high as 10,000 K. Much of Mercury's surface rock could
                            have been vaporized at such temperatures, forming an atmosphere of "rock vapor" that could have been carried away by the solar wind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A third hypothesis proposes that the solar nebula caused drag on the particles from which Mercury was accreting, which meant that lighter particles were lost from the accreting material
                            and not gathered by Mercury. Each hypothesis predicts a different surface composition, and there are two space missions set to make observations. MESSENGER, which ended in 2015,
                            found higher-than-expected potassium and sulfur levels on the surface, suggesting that the giant impact hypothesis and vaporization of the crust and mantle did not occur because potassium
                            and sulfur would have been driven off by the extreme heat of these events. BepiColombo, which will arrive at Mercury in 2025, will make observations to test these hypotheses.
                            The findings so far would seem to favor the third hypothesis; however, further analysis of the data is needed.

                            There are two geologically distinct plains regions on Mercury. Gently rolling, hilly plains in the regions between craters are
                            Mercury's oldest visible surfaces, predating the heavily cratered terrain. These inter-crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters,
                            and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30 km in diameter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Smooth plains are widespread flat areas that fill depressions of various sizes and bear a strong resemblance to the lunar maria. Notably,
                            they fill a wide ring surrounding the Caloris Basin. Unlike lunar maria, the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older inter-crater plains.
                            Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic characteristics, the localisation and rounded, lobate shape of these plains strongly support volcanic origins.
                            All the smooth plains of Mercury formed significantly later than the Caloris basin, as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than
                            on the Caloris ejecta blanket. The floor of the Caloris Basin is filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures
                            in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by the impact, or a large sheet of impact melt.

                             Despite its small size and slow 59-day-long rotation, Mercury has a significant, and apparently global, magnetic field.
                             According to measurements taken by Mariner 10, it is about 1.1% the strength of Earth's. The magnetic-field strength at Mercury's equator
                             is about 300 nT. Like that of Earth, Mercury's magnetic field is dipolar. Unlike Earth's, Mercury's poles are nearly aligned
                             with the planet's spin axis. Measurements from both the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER space probes have indicated that the strength
                             and shape of the magnetic field are stable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is likely that this magnetic field is generated by a dynamo effect, in a manner similar to the magnetic field of Earth.
                            This dynamo effect would result from the circulation of the planet's iron-rich liquid core. Particularly strong tidal effects
                            caused by the planet's high orbital eccentricity would serve to keep the core in the liquid state necessary for this dynamo effect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mercury's magnetic field is strong enough to deflect the solar wind around the planet, creating a magnetosphere. The planet's magnetosphere,
                            though small enough to fit within Earth, is strong enough to trap solar wind plasma. This contributes to the space weathering of the planet's surface.
                            Observations taken by the Mariner 10 spacecraft detected this low energy plasma in the magnetosphere of the planet's nightside.
                            Bursts of energetic particles in the planet's magnetotail indicate a dynamic quality to the planet's magnetosphere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During its second flyby of the planet on October 6, 2008, MESSENGER discovered that Mercury's magnetic field can be extremely "leaky".
                            The spacecraft encountered magnetic "tornadoes" – twisted bundles of magnetic fields connecting the planetary magnetic field to interplanetary space – that were
                            up to 800 km wide or a third of the radius of the planet. These twisted magnetic flux tubes, technically known as flux transfer events,
                            form open windows in the planet's magnetic shield through which the solar wind may enter and directly impact Mercury's surface via magnetic reconnection.
                            This also occurs in Earth's magnetic field. The MESSENGER observations showed the reconnection rate is ten times higher at Mercury,
                            but its proximity to the Sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate observed by MESSENGER.
