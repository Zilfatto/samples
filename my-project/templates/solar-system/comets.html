                        <p>
                            A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to release gases,
                            a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to
                            the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from
                            a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles.
                            The coma may be up to 15 times Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright,
                            a comet may be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky.
                            Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Comets usually have highly eccentric elliptical orbits, and they have a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years
                            to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc,
                            which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of
                            icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards
                            the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide.
                            Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of
                            a comet is called an apparition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Comets are distinguished from asteroids by the presence of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding
                            their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus)
                            and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure
                            or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly
                            all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids are thought to have a different origin
                            from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System. The discovery of main-belt comets
                            and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets. In the early 21st century,
                            the discovery of some minor bodies with long-period comet orbits, but characteristics of inner solar system asteroids,
                            were called Manx comets. They are still classified as comets, such as C/2014 S3 (PANSTARRS). 27 Manx comets were found from 2013 to 2017.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As of July 2019 there are 6,619 known comets, a number that is steadily increasing as they are discovered. However,
                            this represents only a tiny fraction of the total potential comet population, as the reservoir of comet-like bodies in the outer Solar System
                            (in the Oort cloud) is estimated to be one trillion. Roughly one comet per year is visible to the naked eye, though many of those are
                            faint and unspectacular. Particularly bright examples are called "great comets". Comets have been visited by unmanned probes such as
                            the European Space Agency's Rosetta, which became the first to land a robotic spacecraft on a comet, and NASA's Deep Impact,
                            which blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior.

                        <p>
                            The solid, core structure of a comet is known as the nucleus. Cometary nuclei are composed of an amalgamation of rock, dust, water ice,
                            and frozen carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, and ammonia. As such, they are popularly described as "dirty snowballs"
                            after Fred Whipple's model. However, many comets have a higher dust content, leading them to be called "icy dirtballs".
                            The term "icy dirtballs" arose after observation of Comet 9P/Tempel 1 collision with an "impactor" probe sent by NASA Deep Impact mission
                            in July 2005. Research conducted in 2014 suggests that comets are like "deep fried ice cream", in that their surfaces are formed of
                            dense crystalline ice mixed with organic compounds, while the interior ice is colder and less dense.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The surface of the nucleus is generally dry, dusty or rocky, suggesting that the ices are hidden beneath a surface crust several metres thick.
                            In addition to the gases already mentioned, the nuclei contain a variety of organic compounds, which may include methanol, hydrogen cyanide,
                            formaldehyde, ethanol, ethane, and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain hydrocarbons and amino acids. In 2009,
                            it was confirmed that the amino acid glycine had been found in the comet dust recovered by NASA's Stardust mission. In August 2011, a report,
                            based on NASA studies of meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting DNA and RNA components
                            (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have been formed on asteroids and comets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The outer surfaces of cometary nuclei have a very low albedo, making them among the least reflective objects found in the Solar System.
                            The Giotto space probe found that the nucleus of Halley's Comet reflects about four percent of the light that falls on it,
                            and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly's surface reflects less than 3.0%; by comparison, asphalt reflects seven percent.
                            The dark surface material of the nucleus may consist of complex organic compounds. Solar heating drives off lighter volatile compounds,
                            leaving behind larger organic compounds that tend to be very dark, like tar or crude oil. The low reflectivity of cometary surfaces
                            causes them to absorb the heat that drives their outgassing processes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Comet nuclei with radii of up to 30 kilometers (19 mi) have been observed, but ascertaining their exact size is difficult.
                            The nucleus of 322P/SOHO is probably only 100–200 meters (330–660 ft) in diameter. A lack of smaller comets being detected despite
                            the increased sensitivity of instruments has led some to suggest that there is a real lack of comets smaller than 100 meters (330 ft) across.
                            Known comets have been estimated to have an average density of 0.6 g/cm3 (0.35 oz/cu in). Because of their low mass,
                            comet nuclei do not become spherical under their own gravity and therefore have irregular shapes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Roughly six percent of the near-Earth asteroids are thought to be extinct nuclei of comets that no longer experience outgassing,
                            including 14827 Hypnos and 3552 Don Quixote.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Results from the Rosetta and Philae spacecraft show that the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko has no magnetic field,
                            which suggests that magnetism may not have played a role in the early formation of planetesimals.
                            Further, the ALICE spectrograph on Rosetta determined that electrons (within 1 km (0.62 mi) above the comet nucleus) produced from
                            photoionization of water molecules by solar radiation, and not photons from the Sun as thought earlier, are responsible for
                            the degradation of water and carbon dioxide molecules released from the comet nucleus into its coma. Instruments on the Philae lander
                            found at least sixteen organic compounds at the comet's surface, four of which
                            (acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde) have been detected for the first time on a comet.

                            The streams of dust and gas thus released form a huge and extremely thin atmosphere around the comet called the "coma".
                            The force exerted on the coma by the Sun's radiation pressure and solar wind cause an enormous "tail" to form pointing away from the Sun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The coma is generally made of water and dust, with water making up to 90% of the volatiles that outflow from the nucleus when
                            the comet is within 3 to 4 astronomical units (450,000,000 to 600,000,000 km; 280,000,000 to 370,000,000 mi) of the Sun.
                            The H 2O parent molecule is destroyed primarily through photodissociation and to a much smaller extent photoionization,
                            with the solar wind playing a minor role in the destruction of water compared to photochemistry. Larger dust particles are left along
                            the comet's orbital path whereas smaller particles are pushed away from the Sun into the comet's tail by light pressure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although the solid nucleus of comets is generally less than 60 kilometers (37 mi) across, the coma may be thousands
                            or millions of kilometers across, sometimes becoming larger than the Sun. For example, about a month after an outburst in October 2007,
                            comet 17P/Holmes briefly had a tenuous dust atmosphere larger than the Sun. The Great Comet of 1811 also had a coma roughly
                            the diameter of the Sun. Even though the coma can become quite large, its size can decrease about the time it crosses
                            the orbit of Mars around 1.5 astronomical units (220,000,000 km; 140,000,000 mi) from the Sun.
                            At this distance the solar wind becomes strong enough to blow the gas and dust away from the coma, and in doing so enlarging the tail.
                            Ion tails have been observed to extend one astronomical unit (150 million km) or more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Both the coma and tail are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System,
                            the dust reflects sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without
                            the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience
                            a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time.
                            This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.

                            In 1996, comets were found to emit X-rays. This greatly surprised astronomers because X-ray emission is usually associated
                            with very high-temperature bodies. The X-rays are generated by the interaction between comets and the solar wind:
                            when highly charged solar wind ions fly through a cometary atmosphere, they collide with cometary atoms and molecules, "stealing" one
                            or more electrons from the atom in a process called "charge exchange". This exchange or transfer of an electron to
                            the solar wind ion is followed by its de-excitation into the ground state of the ion by the emission of X-rays and far ultraviolet photons.

                        <p>
                            Bow shocks form as a result of the interaction between the solar wind and the cometary ionosphere,
                            which is created by ionization of gases in the coma. As the comet approaches the Sun,
                            increasing outgassing rates cause the coma to expand, and the sunlight ionizes gases in the coma.
                            When the solar wind passes through this ion coma, the bow shock appears.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first observations were made in the 1980s and 90s as several spacecraft flew by comets 21P/Giacobini–Zinner,
                            1P/Halley, and 26P/Grigg–Skjellerup. It was then found that the bow shocks at comets are wider and more gradual
                            than the sharp planetary bow shocks seen at, for example, Earth. These observations were all made near perihelion
                            when the bow shocks already were fully developed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Rosetta spacecraft observed the bow shock at comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko at an early stage of bow shock development
                            when the outgassing increased during the comet's journey toward the Sun. This young bow shock was called
                            the "infant bow shock". The infant bow shock is asymmetric and, relative to the distance to the nucleus,
                            wider than fully developed bow shocks.

                        <p>
                            In the outer Solar System, comets remain frozen and inactive and are extremely difficult or
                            impossible to detect from Earth due to their small size. Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in
                            the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope
                            but these detections have been questioned. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System,
                            solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus,
                            carrying dust away with them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The streams of dust and gas each form their own distinct tail, pointing in slightly different directions.
                            The tail of dust is left behind in the comet's orbit in such a manner that
                            it often forms a curved tail called the type II or dust tail. At the same time, the ion or type I tail,
                            made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun because this gas is more strongly affected by
                            the solar wind than is dust, following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory.
                            On occasions—such as when Earth passes through a comet's orbital plane, the antitail,
                            pointing in the opposite direction to the ion and dust tails, may be seen.

                            The observation of antitails contributed significantly to the discovery of solar wind. The ion tail is formed as a result of
                            the ionization by solar ultra-violet radiation of particles in the coma. Once the particles have been ionized,
                            they attain a net positive electrical charge, which in turn gives rise to an "induced magnetosphere" around the comet.
                            The comet and its induced magnetic field form an obstacle to outward flowing solar wind particles.
                            Because the relative orbital speed of the comet and the solar wind is supersonic, a bow shock is formed upstream of
                            the comet in the flow direction of the solar wind. In this bow shock, large concentrations of cometary ions
                            (called "pick-up ions") congregate and act to "load" the solar magnetic field with plasma,
                            such that the field lines "drape" around the comet forming the ion tail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the ion tail loading is sufficient, the magnetic field lines are squeezed together to the point where,
                            at some distance along the ion tail, magnetic reconnection occurs. This leads to a "tail disconnection event".
                            This has been observed on a number of occasions, one notable event being recorded on 20 April 2007,
                            when the ion tail of Encke's Comet was completely severed while the comet passed through a coronal mass ejection.
                            This event was observed by the STEREO space probe.
                        </p>

                            In 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of the planet Venus streams outwards in a manner similar to
                            the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions."
