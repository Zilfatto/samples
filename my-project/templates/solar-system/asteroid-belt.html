                            The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, located roughly between the orbits of
                            the planets Jupiter and Mars, that is occupied by a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies,
                            of many sizes but much smaller than planets, called asteroids or minor planets. This asteroid belt is also called
                            the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as
                            near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea.
                            The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto,
                            and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ceres, the only object in the asteroid belt large enough to be a dwarf planet, is about 950 km in diameter,
                            whereas Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea have mean diameters of less than 600 km. The remaining bodies range down to
                            the size of a dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it
                            without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family
                            whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within the asteroid belt are
                            categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type),
                            and metal-rich (M-type).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals. Planetesimals are
                            the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations
                            from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet.
                            Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered.
                            As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history.
                            Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets.
                            Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms
                            an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.

                            Classes of small Solar System bodies in other regions are the near-Earth objects, the centaurs, the Kuiper belt objects,
                            the scattered disc objects, the sednoids, and the Oort cloud objects.

                            On 22 January 2014, ESA scientists reported the detection, for the first definitive time, of water vapor on Ceres,
                            the largest object in the asteroid belt. The detection was made by using the far-infrared abilities of
                            the Herschel Space Observatory. The finding was unexpected because comets, not asteroids,
                            are typically considered to "sprout jets and plumes". According to one of the scientists,
                            "The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids."

                            In 1802, shortly after discovering Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments of
                            a much larger planet that once occupied the Marsâ€“Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion
                            or a cometary impact many million years before (Odessan astronomer K. N. Savchenko suggested that Ceres, Pallas, Juno,
                            and Vesta were escaped moons rather than fragments of the exploded planet). The large amount of energy required
                            to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Moon,
                            does not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become
                            difficult to explain if they come from the same planet. In 2018, a study from researchers at the University of Florida found
                            the asteroid belt was created from the remnants of several ancient planets instead of a single planet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A hypothesis to the asteroid belt creation is that in general, in the Solar System, a planetary formation is thought
                            to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust
                            and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that
                            then further condensed to form the Sun and planets. During the first few million years of the Solar System's history,
                            an accretion process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles, which gradually increased in size.
                            Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction
                            and become planetesimals. This gravitational accretion led to the formation of the planets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Planetesimals within the region which would become the asteroid belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity
                            to form a planet. Instead, they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding. In regions where
                            the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion,
                            preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. Orbital resonances occurred where the orbital period of an object in
                            the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit;
                            the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances.
                            As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt,
                            dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.

                        <p>
                            During the early history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, allowing elements within them
                            to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have
                            undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of
                            the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets),
                            and had generally ended about 4.5 billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation.
                            In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated
                            from Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly,
                            within 10 million years of the Solar System's origin.

                            The asteroids are not samples of the primordial Solar System. They have undergone considerable evolution since
                            their formation, including internal heating (in the first few tens of millions of years), surface melting from impacts,
                            space weathering from radiation, and bombardment by micrometeorites. Although some scientists refer to
                            the asteroids as residual planetesimals, other scientists consider them distinct.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The current asteroid belt is believed to contain only a small fraction of the mass of the primordial belt.
                            Computer simulations suggest that the original asteroid belt may have contained the mass equivalent to the Earth.
                            Primarily because of gravitational perturbations, most of the material was ejected from the belt
                            within about 1 million years of formation, leaving behind less than 0.1% of the original mass. Since their formation,
                            the size distribution of the asteroid belt has remained relatively stable: there has been no significant increase
                            or decrease in the typical dimensions of the main-belt asteroids.
                        </p>

                            The 4:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter, at a radius 2.06 AU, can be considered the inner boundary of the asteroid belt.
                            Perturbations by Jupiter send bodies straying there into unstable orbits. Most bodies formed within the radius of
                            this gap were swept up by Mars (which has an aphelion at 1.67 AU) or ejected by its gravitational perturbations
                            in the early history of the Solar System. The Hungaria asteroids lie closer to the Sun than the 4:1 resonance,
                            but are protected from disruption by their high inclination.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the asteroid belt was first formed, the temperatures at a distance of 2.7 AU from the Sun formed a "snow line" below
                            the freezing point of water. Planetesimals formed beyond this radius were able to accumulate ice.
                            In 2006 it was announced that a population of comets had been discovered within the asteroid belt beyond the snow line,
                            which may have provided a source of water for Earth's oceans. According to some models,
                            there was insufficient outgassing of water during the Earth's formative period to form the oceans,
                            requiring an external source such as a cometary bombardment.

                            The current belt consists primarily of three categories of asteroids: C-type or carbonaceous asteroids,
                            S-type or silicate asteroids, and M-type or metallic asteroids.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Carbonaceous asteroids, as their name suggests, are carbon-rich. They dominate the asteroid belt's outer regions.
                            Together they comprise over 75% of the visible asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids
                            and have a very low albedo. Their surface composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.
                            Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements
                            and volatiles removed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            S-type (silicate-rich) asteroids are more common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun.
                            The spectra of their surfaces reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds.
                            This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition,
                            probably through melting and reformation. They have a relatively high albedo and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of the total population; their spectra resemble that of iron-nickel.
                            Some are believed to have formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision.
                            However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example,
                            the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope does not appear to be primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt,
                            the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7 AU. It is not yet clear whether all M-types are
                            compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One mystery of the asteroid belt is the relative rarity of V-type or basaltic asteroids. Theories of asteroid formation predict
                            that objects the size of Vesta or larger should form crusts and mantles, which would be composed mainly of basaltic rock,
                            resulting in more than half of all asteroids being composed either of basalt or olivine. Observations, however,
                            suggest that 99 percent of the predicted basaltic material is missing. Until 2001, most basaltic bodies discovered in
                            the asteroid belt were believed to originate from the asteroid Vesta (hence their name V-type). However, the discovery of
                            the asteroid 1459 Magnya revealed a slightly different chemical composition from the other basaltic asteroids discovered until then,
                            suggesting a different origin. This hypothesis was reinforced by the further discovery in 2007 of two asteroids in the outer belt,
                            7472 Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16, with a differing basaltic composition that could not have originated from Vesta.
                            These latter two are the only V-type asteroids discovered in the outer belt to date.

                            The temperature of the asteroid belt varies with the distance from the Sun. For dust particles within the belt,
                            typical temperatures range from 200 K (âˆ’73 Â°C) at 2.2 AU down to 165 K (âˆ’108 Â°C) at 3.2 AU However, due to rotation,
                            the surface temperature of an asteroid can vary considerably as the sides are alternately exposed to solar radiation
                            and then to the stellar background.
