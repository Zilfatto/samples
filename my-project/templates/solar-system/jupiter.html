                             Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth
                             that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.
                             Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations
                             since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough
                             for its reflected light to cast shadows, and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of
                            the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets,
                            Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid
                            (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes,
                            resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm
                            that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system
                            and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has 79 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.
                            Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.

                            Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet on December 4, 1973; Pioneer 10 identified plasma
                            in Jupiter's magnetic field and also found that Jupiter's magnetic tail was nearly 800 million kilometers long, covering the entire distance to Saturn.
                            Jupiter has been explored on a number of occasions by robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979,
                            and later by the Galileo orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe,
                            which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno,
                            which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include
                            the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.

                            Jupiter has the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, spanning over 5,000 km (3,000 mi) in altitude. Because Jupiter has no surface,
                            the base of its atmosphere is usually considered to be the point at which atmospheric pressure is equal to 100 kPa (1.0 bar).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jupiter is perpetually covered with clouds composed of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are located in
                            the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into
                            lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence.
                            Wind speeds of 100 m/s (360 km/h) are common in zonal jets. The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity
                            from year to year, but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The cloud layer is only about 50 km (31 mi) deep, and consists of at least two decks of clouds: a thick lower deck and a thin clearer region.
                            There may also be a thin layer of water clouds underlying the ammonia layer. Supporting the idea of water clouds are
                            the flashes of lightning detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter. These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times
                            as powerful as lightning on Earth. The water clouds are assumed to generate thunderstorms in the same way as terrestrial thunderstorms,
                            driven by the heat rising from the interior.

                            The orange and brown coloration in the clouds of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when they are exposed
                            to ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be phosphorus,
                            sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons. These colorful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds.
                            The zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.

                        <p>
                            Jupiter's low axial tilt means that the poles constantly receive less solar radiation than at the planet's equatorial region.
                            Convection within the interior of the planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.

                            Jupiter's magnetic field is fourteen times as strong as that of Earth, ranging from 4.2 gauss (0.42 mT) at the equator
                            to 10–14 gauss (1.0–1.4 mT) at the poles, making it the strongest in the Solar System (except for sunspots).
                            This field is thought to be generated by eddy currents—swirling movements of conducting materials—within
                            the liquid metallic hydrogen core. The volcanoes on the moon Io emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide
                            forming a gas torus along the moon's orbit. The gas is ionized in the magnetosphere producing sulfur and oxygen ions.
                            They, together with hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of Jupiter, form a plasma sheet
                            in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet causing deformation
                            of the dipole magnetic field into that of magnetodisk. Electrons within the plasma sheet generate
                            a strong radio signature that produces bursts in the range of 0.6–30 MHz.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At about 75 Jupiter radii from the planet, the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock.
                            Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it
                            and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side
                            and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within
                            the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The magnetosphere of Jupiter is responsible for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet's polar regions.
                            Volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io (see below) injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a torus
                            of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfvén waves
                            that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through
                            a cyclotron maser mechanism, and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects
                            this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.
